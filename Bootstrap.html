<h2>
  My Experience with Web Design and Development has been a 
  learning and rewarding process in the knowledge and understanding 
  of getting the overall fundamentals and steps it takes to being 
  successful in this field of study.
</h2>

<h3>
  What I hope to gain from this course is learning a new skill set that 
  I can use that will benefitme as I continue to pursue my degree.
</h3>

<h4>
  What I would like to do with my new web design knowledge in the future 
    is to be able to create a website that I could be proud to show all the 
    skills that I have learned while doing my craft. </p>
